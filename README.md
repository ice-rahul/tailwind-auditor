# Tailwind Auditor

We are trying to build an npm package that can help us audit the project to highlight best practices of tailwind CSS

We aim to create an MVP that should contain the following

- [x] Create an installable npm package
- [x] Create a script that can be run in the project which can print Hello world
- [ ] Update script to check for package.json in the project to ensure that the project is using tailwind
- [ ] Update the script to check for tailwind config files
- [ ] Update the script the see files for tailwind class names used in the project
- [ ] Update the script to provide audit suggestions in the command line
- [ ] Update the script to provide these suggestions in a txt file
